# instagrambot
Python bot that demonstrates Selenium capabilities for Instagram. Likes and comments on posts with a given hashtag.

# Configuration
The only modifications required are in 'settings.py'. Put a valid login and input you desired hashtags. Unless you know what you're doing, I'd leave 'main.py' alone.

# Setup
If you don't know how to install the requirements, I'm not gonna help you. There's too many bots on Instagram already; this is just for the Python community.
